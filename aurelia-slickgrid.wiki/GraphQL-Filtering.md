The implementation of a GraphQL Service requires a certain structure to follow for `Aurelia-Slickgrid` to work correctly (it will fail if your GraphQL Schema is any different than what is shown below).

### Implementation
For the implementation in your code, refer to the [GraphQL Service](/ghiscoding/aurelia-slickgrid/wiki/GraphQL) section.

### filterBy
The filtering uses `filterBy` with a structure which we think is flexible enough. The query will have a `filterBy` argument with an array of filter properties:
- `filterBy`: array of filter object(s) (see below)
  - `field`: field name to filter
  - `value`: search filter value
  - `operator`: a GraphQL enum (server side) that can have 1 of these choices:
    - `LT`, `LE`, `GT`, `GE`, `NE`, `EQ`, `Contains`, `StartsWith`, `EndsWith`, `IN`, `NIN`
      - `Contains` is the default and will be used (by the grid) when operator is not provided
      - `IN` and `NIN` (Not IN) are mainly used for multi-select filtering

**Note:** the `filterBy` order is following the order of how the filter objects were entered in the array.
 
For example, a filter that would search for a firstName that starts with "John"
- matches: "John", "Johnny", ...
```javascript
  users (first: 20, offset: 10, filterBy: [{field: firstName, operator: StartsWith, value: 'John'}]) {
    totalCount
    pageInfo {
      hasNextPage
    }
    nodes {
      name
      firstName
      lastName
      gender
    }
  }
```

### Complex Objects
Dealing with complex objects are a little bit more involving. Because of some limitation with our [GraphQL for .Net](https://github.com/graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet) implementation, we decided to leave `field` as regular strings and keep the dot notation within the string. For that behavior to work, a new `keepArgumentFieldDoubleQuotes` property was added that can be passed to the GraphQL `initOptions()` function. For example, given a complex object field (defined in the Column Definition) that is `field: "billing.street"` will give this GraphQL query (if you have `keepArgumentFieldDoubleQuotes` set to True).

##### Grid Definition example
```javascript
import { autoinject } from 'aurelia-framework';
import { GraphqlService } from 'aurelia-slickgrid';

@autoinject()
export class Sample {
  constructor(private graphqlService: GraphqlService ) {
    this.graphqlService.initOptions({
      datasetName: 'users',
      columnDefinitions: this.columnDefinitions,
      keepArgumentFieldDoubleQuotes: true // FALSE by default
    });
  }

  prepareDatagrid(private graphqlService: GraphqlService ) {
    this.columnDefinitions = [
      { id: 'name', name: 'Name', field: 'name', filterable: true, sortable: true },
      { id: 'company', name: 'Company', field: 'company', filterable: true },
      { id: 'billingStreet', name: 'Billing Address Street', field: 'billing.address.street', filterable: true, sortable: true },
      { id: 'billingZip', name: 'Billing Address Zip', field: 'billing.address.zip', filterable: true, sortable: true },
    ];
  }
}

```
##### GraphQL Query
```javascript
// the orderBy/filterBy fields will keep the dot notation while nodes are exploded
{
  users(first: 20, offset: 0, orderBy: [{field: "billing.address.street", direction: ASC}]) {
    totalCount,
    pageInfo {
      hasNextPage
    },
    nodes {
      name,
      company,
      billing {
        address {
          street,
          zip
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

From the previous example, you can see that the `orderBy` keeps the (.) dot notation, while the `nodes` is exploded as it should `billing { street }}`. So keep this in mind while building your backend GraphQL service.
