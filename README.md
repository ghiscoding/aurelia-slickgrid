# Aurelia-Slickgrid
One of the best javascript datagrid [SlickGrid](https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid) which was originally developed by @mleibman is now available to Aurelia. I have tried and used a few datagrids and SlickGrid beats most of them in terms of functionalities and performance (it can easily deal with even a million row).

### SlickGrid Source
We will be using [6pac SlickGrid fork](https://github.com/6pac/SlickGrid/) (the most active fork since the original @mleibman fork was closed some time ago by his author for personal reasons).

### Goal
The goal is of course to be able to run SlickGrid within Aurelia but also to incorporate as much as possible the entire list of functionalities (and more) that SlickGrid offers (you can see a vast list of samples on the [6pac SlickGrid examples](https://github.com/6pac/SlickGrid/wiki/Examples) website).

## Wiki / Documentation
The Wiki is where all the documentation and instructions will go, so please consult the [Aurelia-Slickgrid - Wiki](https://github.com/ghiscoding/aurelia-slickgrid/wiki) before opening any issues. The [Wiki - HOWTO](https://github.com/ghiscoding/aurelia-slickgrid/wiki/HOWTO--Step-by-Step) is a great place to start with.

## Main features
You can see some screenshots below and the instructions down below.

This is a work in progress, but so far here are some of the features that `aurelia-slickgrid` brings (on top of Slickgrid itself):
- Easier use of SlickGrid within `Aurelia` as it is just a component (simply pass a column definitions and a dataset and you're good to go)
- Bootstrap Theme with SASS variables for extra customization (if you create a theme, then please make a PR)
- Auto-resize (boolean flag), will resize the datagrid viewport with available space, that includes when browser resize (basically takes available space from it's parent container)
- Support all SlickGrid [Controls](https://github.com/6pac/SlickGrid/tree/master/controls) and [Plugins](https://github.com/6pac/SlickGrid/tree/master/plugins).
- Row(s) Selection
- Server side (backend) Services (filtering, sorting, pagination)
    - [GraphQL](https://github.com/ghiscoding/aurelia-slickgrid/wiki/GraphQL)
    - [OData](https://github.com/ghiscoding/aurelia-slickgrid/wiki/OData)
- Some features of SlickGrid itself which are working out of the gate
  - Sort/Multi-Sort (client/server side)
  - Header Row with Filters (currently support `Input` and `Select` dropdown, multi-select is planned)
  - Inline Editors (a few defaults were added, and you can easily create custom ones too)
  - Formatters (this as well includes some defaults and they are customizable)
  - Optimized DataView which brings a lot of functionalities (sort, grouping, and more)
    - even server side data is saved back into a SlickGrid DataView to use these functionalities (e.g grouping)
  - All the [SlickGrid Events](https://github.com/6pac/SlickGrid/wiki/Grid-Events) are supported, see the [Wiki](https://github.com/ghiscoding/aurelia-slickgrid/wiki/Grid-&-DataView-Events)

## Screenshots

Screenshots from the demo app with the `Bootstrap` theme (that is the only available theme, but there is a lot of SASS variables to make it look like Material, or other theme if you wish to. If you create a new theme, please submit a PR).
