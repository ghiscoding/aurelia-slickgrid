One of the best javascript datagrid [SlickGrid](https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid) which was originally developed by @mleibman is now available to Aurelia. I have used a few datagrids and SlickGrid beats most of them in terms of functionalities and performance (it can easily deal with even a million row). We will be using the [6pac/SlickGrid](https://github.com/6pac/SlickGrid/) fork, this is the most active fork since the original @mleibman fork was closed some time ago by his author for personal reasons. Also worth to know, I also contributed a lot to the 6pac/SlickGrid fork for the benefit of Aurelia-Slickgrid.

### Demo page

`Aurelia-Slickgrid` supports both `Bootstrap 3`, `Bootstrap 4` and even `Bootstrap 5`, you can see a demo of each one below.
- [Bootstrap 3 demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/aurelia-slickgrid) / [examples repo](https://github.com/ghiscoding/aurelia-slickgrid-demos/tree/master/webpack-bs3-demo)
- [Bootstrap 4 demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/aurelia-slickgrid-demos) / [examples repo](https://github.com/ghiscoding/aurelia-slickgrid-demos/tree/master/webpack-bs4-demo)
- [Bootstrap 5 repo (no live demo)](https://github.com/ghiscoding/aurelia-slickgrid-demos/tree/master/webpack-bs5-demo)

There are also 2 new Themes, Material & Salesforce that are available as well and if you wish to use SVG then take a look at the [Wiki - SVG Icons](https://github.com/ghiscoding/aurelia-slickgrid/wiki/SVG--Icons).

#### Working Demos
For complete working local demos, you can clone the [Aurelia-Slickgrid Demos](https://github.com/ghiscoding/aurelia-slickgrid-demos) repository (instruction are provided in the repo). This repo provides multiple samples (RequireJS, WebPack, CLI, ...) and also worth to know that the 2 WebPacks demos are updated frequently since they are the actual [Bootstrap 3 demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/aurelia-slickgrid) / [Bootstrap 4 demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/aurelia-slickgrid-demos/#/slickgrid).

## Wiki / Documentation
The Wiki is where all the documentation and instructions will go, so please consult the [Aurelia-Slickgrid - Wiki](https://github.com/ghiscoding/aurelia-slickgrid/wiki) before opening any issues. The [Wiki - HOWTO](https://github.com/ghiscoding/aurelia-slickgrid/wiki/HOWTO--Step-by-Step) is a great place to start with.

## Usage

#### How to load data with `Fetch-Client` or `Http-Client`?
You might notice that all demos are made with mocked dataset that are embedded in each examples, that is mainly for demo purposes, but you might be wondering how to connect this with an `FetchClient`? Easy... just replace the mocked data, assigned to the `dataset` property, by your `FetchClient` call and that's it. The `dataset` property can be changed at any time, which is why you can use local data and/or connect it to a `Promise` or an async call with `FetchClient` (internally it's just a SETTER that refreshes the grid). See [Example 22](https://ghiscoding.github.io/aurelia-slickgrid/#/slickgrid/example22) for a demo showing how to load a JSON file with `FetchClient`.
