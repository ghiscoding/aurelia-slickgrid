### Brief introduction
One of the best JavasSript datagrid [SlickGrid](https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid), which was originally developed by @mleibman, is now available to Aurelia. SlickGrid beats most other datagrids in terms of features, customizability and performance (it can easily deal with even a million row). Aurelia-Slickgrid is a wrapper on top of SlickGrid and it requires [Slickgrid-Universal](https://github.com/ghiscoding/slickgrid-universal/) dependency since the original one was put on pause by its original author for personal reasons and originally we used the `6pac/SlickGrid` fork but that was dropped in v7.0, so we no longer need external SlickGrid dependencies anymore apart from Slickgrid-Universal since [v7.0](https://github.com/ghiscoding/aurelia-slickgrid/releases/tag/v7.0.1). Also, SlickGrid was recently refactored to be browser native, which means that jQuery is no longer required in Aurelia-Slickgrid v6.0 and higher.

`Aurelia-Slickgrid` works with all `Bootstrap` versions, you can see a demo of each one below. There are also extra styling themes for not just Bootstrap but also Material & Salesforce which are also available. You can also use different SVG icons, you may want to look at the [Docs - SVG Icons](https://ghiscoding.gitbook.io/aurelia-slickgrid/styling/svg-icons)
- [Bootstrap 4 demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/aurelia-slickgrid-demos) / [examples repo](https://github.com/ghiscoding/aurelia-slickgrid-demos/tree/master/webpack-bs4-demo)
- [Bootstrap 5 demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/aurelia-slickgrid) / [examples repo](https://github.com/ghiscoding/aurelia-slickgrid-demos/tree/master/webpack-bs5-demo)

There are also 2 new Themes, Material & Salesforce that are available as well and if you wish to use SVG then take a look at the [Docs - SVG Icons](https://ghiscoding.gitbook.io/aurelia-slickgrid/styling/svg-icons).

#### Working Demos
For a complete set of working demos (over 30 examples), we strongly suggest you to clone the [Aurelia-Slickgrid Demos](https://github.com/ghiscoding/aurelia-slickgrid-demos) repository (instructions are provided in the demo repo). The repo provides multiple demos and they are updated every time a new version is out, so it is updated frequently and is also used as the GitHub live demo page for both the [Bootstrap 5 demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/aurelia-slickgrid) and [Bootstrap 4 demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/aurelia-slickgrid-demos).

For a complete working set of demos, you can clone the [Aurelia-Slickgrid Demos](https://github.com/ghiscoding/aurelia-slickgrid-demos) repository (instructions are provided in the demo repo). This repo provides multiple samples (RequireJS, WebPack, CLI, ...) and it is also worth to know that the 2 WebPacks demos are updated frequently since they are the actual live GitHub [Bootstrap 4 demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/aurelia-slickgrid-demos/#/slickgrid) / [Bootstrap 5 demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/aurelia-slickgrid).

## Documentation
The [Documentation](https://ghiscoding.gitbook.io/aurelia-slickgrid/) is powered by GitBook and is where you'll find all the documentation and instructions for the lib, so please consult the documentation before opening any new issue. The [Docs - Quick Start](https://ghiscoding.gitbook.io/aurelia-slickgrid/getting-started/quick-start) is a great place to start with.

### Latest News & Releases
Check out the [Releases](https://github.com/ghiscoding/aurelia-slickgrid/releases) section for all latest News & Releases.

## Fully Tested with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) (Unit Tests) - [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) (E2E tests)
Aurelia-Slickgrid has **100%** Unit Test Coverage, we are talking of 15,000+ lines of code (3,750+ unit tests, most of these tests were moved into Slickgrid-Universal) fully tested with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/). On the UI side, all Aurelia-Slickgrid Example are tested with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/), there are over 550+ Cypress E2E tests.

## Usage

#### How to load data with `Fetch-Client` or `Http-Client`?
You might have noticed that all demos are made with mocked dataset that are embedded in each examples, that is mainly for demo purposes, but you might be wondering how to connect this with a `FetchClient` or `Http-Client`? Easy... just replace the mocked data, assigned to the `dataset` property, by your `FetchClient` call and that's it. The `dataset` property can be changed at any time, which is why you can use local data and/or connect it to a `Promise` or an async call with `FetchClient` (internally it's just a SETTER that refreshes the grid). See [Example 22](https://ghiscoding.github.io/aurelia-slickgrid/#/slickgrid/example22) for a demo showing how to load a JSON file with `FetchClient`.

## Main features
You can see some screenshots below and visit the [Documentation](https://ghiscoding.gitbook.io/aurelia-slickgrid/getting-started/quick-start) website.

## Missing features
What if `Aurelia-Slickgrid` is missing feature(s) compare to the original core library [6pac/SlickGrid](https://github.com/6pac/SlickGrid/)?

Fear not, you can simply reference the `SlickGrid` and `DataView` objects, just like in the core lib (they are exposed through Custom Events). For more info continue reading on [Docs - SlickGrid & DataView objects](https://ghiscoding.gitbook.io/aurelia-slickgrid/slick-grid-dataview-objects/slickgrid-dataview-objects) and [Docs - Grid & DataView Events](https://ghiscoding.gitbook.io/aurelia-slickgrid/events/grid-dataview-events)
