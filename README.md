### Brief introduction
One of the best JavasSript datagrid [SlickGrid](https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid), which was originally developed by @mleibman, is now available to the Aurelia world. SlickGrid beats most other datagrids in terms of features, customizability & performance (running smoothly with even a million rows). Aurelia-Slickgrid is a wrapper on top of [Slickgrid-Universal](https://github.com/ghiscoding/slickgrid-universal/) (which is required), in the early beginning we used the `6pac/SlickGrid` fork but that was dropped in >=[v7.0](https://github.com/ghiscoding/aurelia-slickgrid/releases/tag/v7.0.3) since Slickgrid-Universal is now a standalone project. SlickGrid was also recently rewritten with browser native code (no more ~jQuery~ üéâ).

### Versions Compatibility

#### Working Demos
For a complete set of working demos (over 30 examples), we strongly suggest you to clone the [Aurelia-Slickgrid Demos](https://github.com/ghiscoding/aurelia-slickgrid-demos) repository (instructions are provided in the demo repo). The repo provides multiple demos and they are updated every time a new version is out, so it is updated frequently and is also used as the GitHub live demo page for both the [Bootstrap 5 demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/aurelia-slickgrid) and [Bootstrap 5 demo (single Locale)](https://ghiscoding.github.io/aurelia-slickgrid-demos).

For a complete working set of demos, you can clone the [Aurelia-Slickgrid Demos](https://github.com/ghiscoding/aurelia-slickgrid-demos) repository (instructions are provided in the demo repo). This repo provides multiple samples (RequireJS, WebPack, CLI, ...) and it is also worth to know that the 2 WebPacks demos are updated frequently since they are the actual live GitHub [Bootstrap 5 demo (single Locale)](https://ghiscoding.github.io/aurelia-slickgrid-demos/#/slickgrid) / [Bootstrap 5 demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/aurelia-slickgrid).
